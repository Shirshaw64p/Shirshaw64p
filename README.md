## Quantified Impact & Metrics

### Metrics Methodology & Scope

All reported metrics are derived from:
- Authorized testing environments
- Vulnerability disclosure programs
- Research and benchmarking against intentionally vulnerable applications
- Internally documented testing artifacts and evidence logs

Where public disclosure is restricted, detailed evidence is maintained privately and can be shared under appropriate authorization.

### Vulnerability Research
- **30+ validated vulnerabilities** across web applications, APIs, and enterprise systems  
- **High-severity findings** including authentication bypass, IDOR, and access-control failures  
- **100% responsible disclosure rate**, with remediation confirmation where available  

### Red Team & Offensive Testing
- Benchmarked an autonomous red teaming system against **OWASP Juice Shop (172 known vulnerabilities)**  
- **31+ verified exploit paths** identified within a **12-hour development window**  
- Demonstrated attack coverage comparable to **multi-week human VAPT engagements**

### Automation & Scale
- **>70% reduction in manual testing time** in controlled benchmarks  
- Concurrent multi-agent orchestration with full evidence capture  
- Repeatable attack pipelines suitable for continuous security testing

### Severity Distribution (Representative)
- Critical / High: Majority of validated findings  
- Medium: Context-dependent exploitation paths  
- Low: Informational findings documented for completeness

## Certifications (Verified Expertise)

- Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v12) – EC-Council  
- eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT)  
- ISC2 – Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)  
- Certified Network Penetration Professional (CNPen)

## Core Technical Domains

### SOC Experience (Operational Context)

Currently serving in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment, contributing to detection, investigation, and response workflows.

**Operational Exposure Includes:**
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Email security triage and phishing analysis
- Network security monitoring
- Incident documentation and escalation
- Ticketing and case management workflows

This experience directly informs my red team and research work by identifying real-world detection gaps and response limitations.

### Offensive Security & Red Teaming
- End-to-end attack chains (initial access → impact)  
- Authentication & authorization bypass  
- Business logic exploitation  
- MITRE ATT&CK-aligned adversarial techniques

### SOC-Relevant Analysis
- Detection gap identification  
- Attack-to-alert mismatch analysis  
- Evidence artifacts usable for SOC tuning and IR review

### Vulnerability Research
- API security failures  
- IDOR and object-level authorization flaws  
- Exploit reproducibility and PoC verification

### AI-Assisted Security Automation
- Autonomous pentesting agents  
- Multi-agent orchestration  
- Evidence-first reporting pipelines

## Standards & Compliance Alignment

My work aligns with recognized security standards and frameworks for **testing relevance and control validation**, not formal auditing.

**Frameworks Referenced:**
- OWASP Top 10 (Web and API)
- MITRE ATT&CK
- NIST SP 800-53 (security controls context)
- NIST SP 800-63-3 (digital identity)

**Compliance Contexts:**
- SOC 2 (control effectiveness perspective)
- ISO/IEC 27001 (technical control verification)

All findings are mapped to industry-standard taxonomies to support audit, compliance, and executive review.

---

## Original Contributions

- Designed and implemented **autonomous multi-agent red teaming frameworks**  
- Demonstrated measurable efficiency and coverage gains over manual testing  
- Produced repeatable, verifiable exploit evidence suitable for institutional review  
- Contributions extend **beyond academic or employment requirements**

---

## Evidence Mapping

Selected contributions, metrics, and recognitions are mapped to:
- Original contributions of major significance
- Critical roles in security operations and research
- Sustained national and international impact

A detailed evidence matrix is maintained separately for formal review contexts.

---

## Publications, Review & Academic Activity

- Peer-reviewed and under-review research in cybersecurity and digital identity
- Conference submissions, posters, and technical presentations
- Participation in technical review and evaluation activities where applicable

Details are selectively disclosed to respect publication and review confidentiality.

---

## Recognition & Public Credibility

- Formal recognition from government and large institutions for responsible security research
- Public acknowledgment under vulnerability disclosure programs
- Institutional recognition for cybersecurity research contributions

---

## Professional Philosophy

> Security is demonstrated through exploitation, verified through evidence,  
> and validated through responsible disclosure.

I prioritize:
- Proof over assumptions  
- Impact over volume  
- Authorization, ethics, and documentation

---

## Contact & Collaboration

- Research collaboration (academic or industry)
- SOC, red team, and security research roles
- Responsible vulnerability disclosure coordination
